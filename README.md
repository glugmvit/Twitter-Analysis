## Twitter Analysis

The project aims to get data regarding particular tweets on Twitter which are associated  with a certain feature. This could be a hashtag, a particular user name, an image etc. In the age of social media, it is important to have an impact on people to keep an organisation visible and running. 

Glug MVIT aims to do that through its own active Twitter handle. With every event or project we would like to know about the information related to the following : the reach of organisation, the engagement and activity rate and the users who are influencing or getting influenced by the Twitter activity.

Right now, the code is limited to tracking down the tweets associated with a particular hashtag for a limited period of time but we tend to improvise it by using sentiment analysis and NLP. and build more upon that.
